Quick Fix Guide: Transcription not working in .exe
===================================================

PROBLEM: Transcription works in VSCode but not in compiled .exe

SOLUTION: Already fixed! Just rebuild.

STEPS TO FIX:
1. python build_exe.py
2. Test: dist\FlowBot.exe
3. Record audio and check transcripts folder

WHY IT WAS BROKEN:
- PyInstaller extracts to temp folder (sys._MEIPASS)
- Code was looking for models in wrong location
- Now uses get_resource_path() to find correct location

WHAT WAS CHANGED:
✅ analyzer.py - Added PyInstaller-aware path resolution
✅ build_exe.py - Enhanced imports for audio/voice
✅ FlowBot.spec - Added sounddevice collection
✅ recorder.py - Fixed audio_recording event preservation

HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKS:
1. Run: python test_vosk_path.py
   Should see: "✅ Model loaded successfully!"

2. Build exe: python build_exe.py

3. Test exe: dist\FlowBot.exe
   - Start recording
   - Speak something
   - Stop recording
   - Check console for "[Audio]" messages
   - Check recordings/<session>/transcripts/ folder

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
recordings/
  20251028_HHMMSS/
    recording.wav ✅
    events.json ✅
    transcripts/ ✅
      transcript_20251028_HHMMSS.txt ✅
    screenshots/

If transcripts folder is empty or missing, run test_vosk_path.py
to diagnose the issue.
